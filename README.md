# Hotel_Dashboard_AK
As a business analyst, I have created a comprehensive dashboard using Airbnb data that provides valuable insights into the platform's performance. Here's a summary of the key components and insights included in the dashboard:

1. Listing Overview: This section provides an overview of the Airbnb listings, including the total number of listings, average listing price, and distribution of listings across different property types (e.g., apartments, houses, etc.). It helps understand the overall supply and pricing trends on the platform.

2. Geographic Analysis: This visual component showcases the geographical distribution of Airbnb listings on a map, allowing users to explore the concentration of listings in different areas. It provides insights into popular neighborhoods and can aid in identifying potential investment opportunities.

3. Booking Trends: This section presents booking trends over time, highlighting seasonal patterns, occupancy rates, and the average length of stay. It enables users to understand the demand patterns and plan their pricing and availability strategies accordingly.

4. Reviews and Ratings: This component displays the average rating of listings and allows users to explore reviews. It helps identify the key factors contributing to customer satisfaction and provides insights into areas for improvement.
